# SpringBootProductsAPI_Train
A project to practice what i like

If u want a bigger project of spring boot but way more complex pls go to:

https://bitbucket.org/isep-leti-psoft

Here u can find a project made in spring boot with authorazion, token and a lots of other content. The project is about plans and subscriptions(e.g. SpotiFy). I  the project inside u have the full documentation of project.

Why do this then?

Well, because i like and i want to be updated to new ways of doing the same objective
